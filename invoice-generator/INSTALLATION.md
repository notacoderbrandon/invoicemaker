# Invoice Generator - Installation Guide

## Download and Installation

3. Drag the "Invoice Generator" app to your Applications folder
4. The DMG will automatically unmount after installation

## Running the Application

### First Launch

When you first run the Invoice Generator app, macOS may show a security warning because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate. This is normal and safe. Follow these steps:

#### Method 1: Right-click to Open
1. Go to Applications folder
2. Find "Invoice Generator"
3. **Right-click** on the app and select "Open"
4. Click "Open" in the security dialog that appears
5. The app will now run and be trusted for future launches

#### Method 2: System Preferences (if right-click doesn't work)
1. Try to open the app normally (it will be blocked)
2. Go to **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General**
3. You'll see a message about "Invoice Generator" being blocked
4. Click **"Open Anyway"**
5. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog

### Subsequent Launches

After the first successful launch, you can open the app normally:
- Double-click the app in Applications
- Use Spotlight search
- Use Launchpad

## Troubleshooting

### "App is damaged" error
If you see this error, the DMG file may have been corrupted during download:
1. Delete the downloaded DMG file
2. Re-download the DMG file
3. Try the installation process again

### App won't open
1. Make sure you're using the right-click method for first launch
2. Check System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General
3. Ensure your macOS version is 10.15 or later

### Need help?
If you encounter any issues, please check that you're following the "First Launch" instructions carefully, as the security bypass is required for unsigned applications.
